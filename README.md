### 464XLAT for IPv6-only

Fedora packages [clatd](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/clatd/clatd/index.html) to translates flows from an IPv6-only client to IPv4 hosts via NAT46, so it can be transmitted and translated back via NAT64 in a PLAT device, e.g. at the edge in a CPE or in an ISP network.

This feature likely is not functional, yet.

### Swap on ZRAM

Fedora uses [Swap on ZRAM](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/SwapOnZRAM) by default on all Spins, the [systemd-zram-generator](https://github.com/systemd/zram-generator) is available to configure compressed drives, including setting it up as swap.

Starting with v1.2.1 the zram-generator supports (via https://github.com/systemd/zram-generator/issues/178 and https://github.com/systemd/zram-generator/pull/200) configuring secondary compression algorithms and associated parameters to recompress pages on a zram drive triggering it by touching a knob in sysfs. This allows for some flexibility.

A first scenario would've only compressed huge pages once every three minutes, now a second but more generic use case lets zram absorb swapped out pages quickly but over time would try to recompress every single one of them in batches.

It is important to know that in zram terms _incompressible_ pages are called huge; the Memory Management subsystem also knows [`huge pages`](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/concepts.html#huge-pages) but means something different.

#### Implementation

zram is [configured](files/system/etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf) to use `lz4` as a fast, low-latency compression algorithm and both `zstd` and `lz4hc` were selected for recompression. A default to recompress both `huge` and `idle` pages is used and a maximum of `4096` pages (up to 16 MiB) was selected to not produce unduly burden on the CPU.

The system uses a [zram-recompression.timer](files/system/etc/systemd/system/zram-recompression.timer) to orchestrate the one-off execution of [zram-recompression.service](files/system/etc/systemd/system/zram-recompression.service) which in turn calls [recompress-zram](files/system/usr/sbin/recompress-zram) script. It has grown quite a bit, most functionality exists for debugging purposes. It will first mark `all` pages as idle, then trigger recompression and finally memory compaction.

#### Outcome

On a severely memory constrained device with only 4 GiB, I've observed ratios of roughly 30..40% during normal usage scenarios (Browser, Electron Shells, E-Mail, Password Databases, Synchronization, ...) while the system stays _mostly_ reactive. With this configuration I try to achieve a good user experience, but the capabilities of it are still limited.

## Installation

> **Warning**  
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable), try at your own discretion.

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/blue-build/template:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/blue-build/template:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.

## ISO

If build on Fedora Atomic, you can generate an offline ISO with the instructions available [here](https://blue-build.org/learn/universal-blue/#fresh-install-from-an-iso). These ISOs cannot unfortunately be distributed on GitHub for free due to large sizes, so for public projects something else has to be used for hosting.

## Verification

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/blue-build/template
```
