## Images

All images are built with a selection of common packages and flatpaks. ZRAM is pre-configured to use LZ4 and from 2 x RAM up to 16 GiB as Swap space with recompression, the Virtual Memory management subsystem settings have been configured for both an increased amount of and low latency swapping. The latency improvements come at a price of a higher likelyhood of page faults because readahead has been deactivated.

### Swap on ZRAM

Let's have a look into some articles I've read over time. I did not do many measurements on my own, just rough observations while using my systems, especially the low memory (4 GiB) netbook I'm using for over seven years, and generally fare well with these settings. I'm choosing `lz4` over `zstd` as higher IOPS are - for my use cases - seemingly more important than the compression gain over either lz4 or `lzo-rle`. See linked posts on Reddit and GitHub with some synthetic benchmarks of various settings.

Since before Fedora 33 raised [Swap on ZRAM](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/SwapOnZRAM) to default for all Spins, the [systemd-zram-generator](https://github.com/systemd/zram-generator) was available to configure compressed drives, including setting it up as swap. Starting with v1.2.1 the zram-generator supports configuring recompression, which allows to set secondary compression algorithms to recompress some or all of the pages on any zram drive on a trigger. For the images built from this repository the [zram-recompression.timer](files/system/etc/systemd/system/zram-recompression.timer) orchestrates the trigger, and zram is configure to use both [`zstd` and `lz4hc`](files/system/etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf) to try to recompress first idle and then huge (=incompressible in zram terms) pages. I suppose it would be possible to try to recompress all pages (which are currently not marked as incompressible after actually trying to recompress those) in ZRAM, but this is currently not being used here.

## Installation

> **Warning**  
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable), try at your own discretion.

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/blue-build/template:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/blue-build/template:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.

## ISO

If build on Fedora Atomic, you can generate an offline ISO with the instructions available [here](https://blue-build.org/learn/universal-blue/#fresh-install-from-an-iso). These ISOs cannot unfortunately be distributed on GitHub for free due to large sizes, so for public projects something else has to be used for hosting.

## Verification

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/blue-build/template
```
